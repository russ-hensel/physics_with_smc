### Organization of This Document
This document contains a series of links to interactive SageMath worksheets.  Each worksheet shows how to use various features of SageMath you might use to teaching first semester high school physics. 


### Introduction to SageMath
---

You can find numerous tutorials online for getting started with SageMath but here are a few of the better ones I've found.
- Try an interactive tutorial [here](SageBeginnerTutorial.sagews)
- [Sage for Undergraduates](http://www.gregorybard.com/Sage.html) is a textbook written by Dr. Gregory Bard.  Free pdf versions of the text can be found [here](http://www.gregorybard.com/Sage.html).
- A tutorial from [San Diego State University](http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/~mosulliv/Teaching/sdsu-sage-tutorial/)
- Official [SageMath tutorials](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/prep/index.html)


### Editing SageMath Worksheets
---

You are encouraged to edit these worksheets for your students.  This material is released under the CC-BY 4.0 license.  Please modify these documents to fit the needs of your class and share your changes with others.  Many of the earlier sections could be used in a Modern Physics course with a little editing.

**Editing Tips**
- Everything written in cells that start with %md on the first line are treated as Markdown cells using ([Markdown Tutorial](http://www.markdowntutorial.com/))
- Starting a cell with %html treats everything in the cell as HTML code
- Double-click on the text of a cell to show the code
- The hashtag '#' is used in calculation cells to indicate comments that are not parsed by SageMath

See the [ReadMe](../README.md) for directions on how to copy these documents into your SageMathCloud project

# First Semester High School Physics
---

#### - Units and Significant Figures 
[Units and Significant Figures Interactive Worksheet](Units_and_Sig_Figs.sagews)

This worksheet covers the following SageMath features:

- Performing simple mathematical calculations
- Getting decimal answers
- Specifying number of significant figures
- Working with units
- Substituting in values for unit conversion
- Defining functions

#### Calculations and Graphs
[Calculations and Graphs Interactive Worksheet](Calculations_and_Graphs.sagews)
This worksheet covers the following SageMath features:
- Creating variables
- Defining functions
- Plotting graphs
- Label axes and creating legends on plots





## VPython in SageMathCloud

In addition to doing computation in SageMath, you can also run Jupyter notebooks in SageMathCloud which allows you to use VPython to help model and visualize objects moving and interacting.  The following interactive notebooks will get you started using VPython in SageMathCloud (You can also run them locally in your own version of Jupyter if you'd like).

**Note: If animation screen does not appear when you run a cell, try restarting the kernel by clicking on the `Kernel` button and selecting `Restart and Clear Output`.  This should fix most issues**

### - Getting Started with VPython
[Intro to VPython Jupyter Notebook](Intro_to_Vpython_in_SageMathCloud.ipynb)

This Jupyter notebook will cover the following features:
- How to import VPython
- How to draw spheres on screen
- How to create new canvases
- Using `while` loops in Python
- How to animate a sphere

### Modeling Constant Velocity in VPython
[Modeling Constant Velocity Jupyter Notebook](Modeling_Constant_Velocity-VPython.ipynb)

This Jupyter notebook will cover the following features:
- Animate different shapes with constant velocity
- Create arrows to show direction of motion
- Graph position vs. time

### Constant Acceleration in VPython
[Constant Acceleration Jupyter Notebook](Constant_Acceleration-VPython.ipynb)
- Create objects moving with constant acceleration


### Several demo programs

These demos were written by Bruce Sherwood for Matter and Interaction.  These show off some of the capabilities of VPython

- [Ball and Spring Model](Ball_and_Spring_Model.ipynb)
- [Two charged particles colliding](Charged_particle_collision.ipynb)
- [Double pendulum](Double_pendulum.ipynb)
- [3 Body Orbits](3_Body_Orbit.ipynb)




## Future Worksheets

#### - Spring Forces
#### - Solving Systems of Equations
