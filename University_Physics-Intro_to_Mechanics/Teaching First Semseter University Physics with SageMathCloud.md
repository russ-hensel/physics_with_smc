### Organization of This Document
This document contains a series of links to interactive SageMath worksheets and Jupyter notebooks.  Each worksheet shows how to use various features of SageMath in a calculus-based physics course or how to run VPython in SageMathCloud. 


### Introduction to SageMath
---

You can find numerous tutorials online for getting started with SageMath but here are a few of the better ones I've found.
- Try an interactive tutorial [here](SageBeginnerTutorial.sagews)
- [Sage for Undergraduates](http://www.gregorybard.com/Sage.html) is a textbook written by Dr. Gregory Bard.  Free pdf versions of the text can be found [here](http://www.gregorybard.com/Sage.html).
- A tutorial from [San Diego State University](http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/~mosulliv/Teaching/sdsu-sage-tutorial/)
- Official [SageMath tutorials](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/prep/index.html)


### Editing SageMath Worksheets
---

You are encouraged to edit these worksheets for your students.  This material is released under the CC-BY 4.0 license.  Please modify these documents to fit the needs of your class and share your changes with others.  Many of the earlier sections could be used in a Modern Physics course with a little editing.

**Editing Tips**
- Everything written in cells that start with %md on the first line are treated as Markdown cells (([Markdown Tutorial](http://www.markdowntutorial.com/)))
- Starting a cell with %html treats everything in the cell as HTML code
- Double-click on the text of a cell to show the code
- The hashtag '#' is used in calculation cells to indicate comments that are not parsed by SageMath

See the [ReadMe](../README.md) for directions on how to copy these documents into your SageMathCloud project

## Using VPython in SageMathCloud

[Intro to VPython Jupyter Notebook](Intro_to_VPython_in_SageMathCloud.ipynb)

A short guide on getting started using VPython.
This Jupyter notebook will cover the following features:
- How to import VPython
- How to draw spheres on screen
- How to create new canvases
- Using `while` loops in Python
- How to animate a sphere

### Modeling Constant Velocity in VPython
[Modeling Constant Velocity Jupyter Notebook](Modeling_Constant_Velocity-VPython.ipynb)

This Jupyter notebook will cover the following features:
- Animate different shapes with constant velocity
- Create arrows to show direction of motion
- Graph position vs. time

### Constant Acceleration in VPython
[Constant Acceleration Jupyter Notebook](Constant_Acceleration-VPython.ipynb)

This Jupyter notebook covers the following:
- Create objects moving with constant acceleration


### Creating Motion Diagrams

You can create animations and motion diagrams using VPython and Jupyter notebooks using Physutil, a Python script that makes these things easy.

This notebook covers the following features:
- Including an on-screen timer
- Drawing motion diagrams
- Using Physutil for graphing

Documentation about Physutil can be found [here](https://github.com/perlatmsu/physutil/wiki)


### Bouncing Ball Demo

This notebook is based on the introduction to VPython tutorial on the VPython website.  You can find it [here](http://vpython.org/contents/docs/VPython_Intro.pdf).
