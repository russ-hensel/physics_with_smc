### Organization of This Document
This document contains a series of links to interactive SageMath worksheets.  Each worksheet shows how to use various features of SageMath to teach quantum mechanics.  The quantum mechanics topics are in the order they would be encountered in a traditional quantum mechanics course and show how to solve problems related to each topics.  Additionally, each worksheet has a list of projects for students to further their understanding of quantum mechanics.


### Introduction to SageMath
---

You can find numerous tutorials online for getting started with SageMath but here are a few of the better ones I've found.
- Try the tutorial [here](../SageBeginnerTutorial.sagews)
- [Sage for Undergraduates](http://www.gregorybard.com/Sage.html) is a textbook written by Dr. Gregory Bard.  Free pdf versions of the text can be found [here](http://www.gregorybard.com/Sage.html).

### Editing SageMath Worksheets
---

You are encouraged to edit these worksheets for your students.  This material is released under the CC-BY 4.0 license.  Please modify these documents to fit the needs of your class and share your changes with others.  Many of the earlier sections could be used in a Modern Physics course with a little editing.

**Editing Tips**
- Everything written in cells that start with %md on the first line are treated as Markdown cells using (%todo:find link to markdown)
- Starting a cell with %html treats everything in the cell as HTML code
- Double-click on the text of a cell to show the code
- The hashtag '#' is used in calculation cells to indicate comments that are not parsed by SageMath

See the [ReadMe](../README.md) for directions on how to copy these documents into your SageMathCloud project
